﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Greeting from andre :-)It took me almost 3 weeks to make face mesh build on Visual Studio before I can test and debug easily. So I'd like to share this to anyone who is going to do the same thing like I did. Would be glad if this saves your precious time. Many thanks to mediapipe team for sharing this fantastic work so I can have lot of fun.Before open up Visual Studio 2019 and make the build, install PowerShell if you haven't yet. Have fun!.**Now you know everything I know**
