﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Greeting from andre :-)It took me almost 3 weeks to make face mesh build on Visual Studio so i can test and debug easily. I'd like to share this for anyone who may be interested, and hopefully save your valuable time. Kudos to mediapipe team for sharing me this fastastic work.Before open up Visual Studio 2019, go ./third_party/opencv/x64 and unzip 2 chunky dlls (github 50MB size limit). Have fun!.
